**THIS PACK IS MADE FOR RESIZABLE CLASSIC ONLY, A FIXED/REZISABLE MODERN IS GOING TO BE SEPERATE**
This pack was created to recreate the gameframe of 2006, when hunter was released. With the limitations of resource packs currently, it's not possible to have the same exact appearance as the original. I spent a lot of time searching old references and trying to fit the old interface style with the current so it looks as close to the original style as possible.
Hope you enjoy
