An overhauled version of RuneLite’s 2005 interface, designed to recreate the original 2005 look and feel as closely as possible within OSRS limits. Due to limitations within the Resource Packs plugin, you need to follow the steps below to make everything work correctly.

## Interface

## Required Steps
1. Enable the `Interface Styles` plugin in Runelite and set the `Gameframe` option to `2005`.

2. Go to `Resource Packs` settings and make sure `Don't change Interface Styles gameframe option` is enabled.

3. Disable and then re-enable the `Resource packs` plugin to apply the changes.

## File Path to Make Changes
`C:\Users\YourUsername\.runelite\resource-packs-repository`

**Optional:** Delete the `account_management` icon in the tab folder to use the standard OSRS one. Then disable and re-enable the `Resource Packs` plugin to apply the changes.
