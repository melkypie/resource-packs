# •INTRODUCTION AND SCREENSHOTS
CRAZED is a super shiny HD skin that takes tab icons from default OSRS, 2010 legacy by Shredit, And an rs3 textures pack by sgfost. The skin was originally based off of Noedel's OSRS Grey theme, so you may see a few things from that pack if you look hard enough. This skin is designed for use with the Status bars plugin, otherwise the columns on the sides of the inventory will be a bit bright. Although this pack does have a fixed mode skin, It looks best in resizeable. Some previews of the skin and links to all packs used will be shown below!

## •HOW TO INSTALL:
To install this resource pack for RuneLite, you'll need the 'Resource packs' plugin, which can be found by clicking [here](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs/tree/master).



## •CHANGES

The very vast majority of things have been heavily edited to give everything a nice high quality shiny stone and metal texture, or it's simply been given a tasteful recolor, all while keeping things in a dark mode theme. 

The combat tab uses a mixture of icons from 2010 Legacy and default OSRS, The emotes tab uses RS3 icons, And the slots in the equipment tab have a dark background with bright red icons. I often find myself running off to do slayer, and once i get to my task ive noticed ive forgotten a piece of equipment. I find that the bright red icons help a bit.

The corners around dialogue boxes have been changed to a riveted steel texture. The minimap frame has been turned into a nice shiny dark gunmetal texture, along with the minimap orbs, which have been re-shaped and re-colored as well. The compass has been turned into a shiny, veiny purple eye. It still has the north indicator, and the iris points south, all of which i made sure were lined up with the original compass. I imagine some of you may not like the eye compass though, So i may end up making a V2 for this.

I suggest allowing your spells and prayers to be changed when using this pack. None of the prayer or spell icons have really been changed, Except for when you activate your prayer. The glowing yellow background for when the prayer buttons are activated looks much nicer than the original.
