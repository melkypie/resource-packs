This pack was created to recreate the gameframe of late 2006, when hunter was released. With the limitations of resource packs currently, it's not possible to have the same exact appearance as the original. I spent a lot of time searching old references and trying to fit the old interface style with the current so it looks as close to the original style as possible.
Hope you enjoy

**In order to correctly use in fixed mode theres a couple steps required:**
Go to Runelite's plugins and enable "Interface Styles", open the settings and set 'gameframe' to 2006.

Go to the Resource packs plugin settings and tick the experimental setting at the bottom 'Don't change Interface Styles'

Disable and Reenable the Resource packs plugin, and you should be done.
**If you want to use other packs in fixed mode, you have to make sure to disable the plugin 'Interface Styles' and disable/reenable resource packs for them to work correctly, unless the creators' specify otherwise.**

## Inventory Background
If you only plan on using Fixed mode, or don't like the way the outside of the chatbox/around the stones underneath is fully transparent, download the following images and replace `background.png` and `buttons_background_stones.png` in the chatbox folder.
