# Mermaid Grotto (by W 0 N D 3 R)

Mermaid Grotto is my interpretation of a sailing-themed pack. It features one of the new mermaids (Christina Kebbit-Monkfish) in a neutral, olive-green UI with colorful accents of mostly blue, green, and purple. This pack is heavily customized, intended for chill, aesthetic sailing. It is an acceptable brightness for both dark and light mode, similar to the original UI.

Created all elements using Krita and ibisPaint X by me.
