# DuckScape for RuneLite

![icon](https://file.garden/aPvIhE9PkXWKuMaa/icon.png)

## Description

A resource pack with nature themes. It's really green. And brown.

I really like green. And brown. And nature. And I wasn't really vibing with Sakurascape anymore (it's so damn pink. and bright. and I think I've improved since then?). And TOBlite wasn't green. Or brown enough. I didn't know what to call the pack so it's called "Dusk" because I think that the Fixed Classic background looks like that time of day. Sorry if there aren't enough ducks for this to be called DuckScape. Forgive me (?)

All assets are made by me, and other work can be found [here](https://sayolko.framer.website/resource-packs)
