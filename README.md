Taking the ***2010*** interface style and adding all the necessary sprites to make it ***fully 2010***. I went over everything to make sure everything was changed.		
You can still have interface style plugin enabled for the 2010 healthbar and other options. Make sure to have it to **default**.

Additional settings can be done with the "Customizable XP drops" plugin. The settings are down below.

_I will be making a dark version of this resource pack soon._
