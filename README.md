[OSRS-Dark by iawhd](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs/tree/pack-osrs-dark) but with a few tweaks. This pack works for both fixed and resizable.

## Info
Thanks to iawhd for making [OSRS-Dark theme](https://github.com/melkypie/resource-packs/tree/pack-osrs-dark), which this one is heavily based on. Also thanks to Smob for coming with the idea to tweak some things in the pack.  

I'll try to keep this as up to date with the plugin as possible. If there are any issues or missing sprites/textures, please contact me on Discord: Noedel#0001.
