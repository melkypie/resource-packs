This pack was created to recreate the gameframe of late 2006, when hunter was released. With the limitations of resource packs currently, it's not possible to have the same exact appearance as the original. I spent a lot of time searching old references and trying to fit the old interface style with the current so it looks as close to the original style as possible.
Hope you enjoy

**In order to correctly use in fixed mode theres a couple steps required:**
1. Go to Runelite's plugins and enable "Interface Styles", open the settings and set 'gameframe' to 2006.

2. Go to the Resource packs plugin settings and tick the experimental setting at the bottom 'Don't change Interface Styles'

3. Disable and Reenable the Resource packs plugin, and you should be done.
**If you want to use other packs in fixed mode, you have to make sure to disable the plugin 'Interface Styles' and disable/reenable resource packs for them to work correctly, unless the creators' specify otherwise.**

## Chat
If you prefer to have the chat and stones behind the buttons underneath transparent like the example above, download the following image and replace `background.png` in the chatbox folder. For the stones behind the buttons, open up `buttons_background_stones.png` in the chatbox folder and make the whole image fully transparent.
