HCIM Theme - By: Red Vitreous
- - -
This pack is aimed to cater to HCIM who want to spice up their interface a bit with some
HCIM bling. The Hitpoints stat has been altered a bit to represent a more dangerous look and the theme
in itself is mostly red to match with the Hardcore aesthetic and given some touch-up's.

This pack is usable with Fixed or Resizable mode.
