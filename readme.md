## Known bugs/issues:

- When you get poisoned or venomed, your HP icon will reset to vanilla sprites
  However I have made the sprites for HP_Poisoned, HP_Venomed and HP_Diseased icons for whenever those get added to the base plugin.
- Trading screen 2 (Last confirm before trade accept) has a + type of intersection sprite which I cannot change, however
  it is being fixed soon as far as I know.
- Prayer, Magic spells and Emote icons are still vanilla style, as I cannot change those. I have requested the author of the base plugin
  to make them replaceable but not everything always works out, lets just wait!
